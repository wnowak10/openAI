Playing in Open AI gym. This code uses random search to optimize the OpenAI cart pole problem. See: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0


We randomly initialize weights and then move in large steps from given best parameters. This code borrows heavily from great work of KV Frans: http://kvfrans.com/simple-algoritms-for-solving-cartpole
